# DL5SAY-Collection

The materials contained in this directory may be of some use to the  
amateur community.  They also represent a remarkable work of love  
and devotion on the part of XYL Ursel Kreh, wife to  
Hartmut Hans Kreh DL5SAY, who died in January 2001, aged 54. 

I offer them, through the courtesy of Frau Kreh, to the Amateur  
Community.  Please direct any correspondence to:

The Kreh Antenna Library is a grouping of numerous NEC antenna systems gathered by an avid CEM enthusiast Hartmut Hans and provided recently (2004) by Ursel Kreh.  In 2001, these were also provided to Bill Walker and available on a few NEC sites as the  DL5SAY Collection.  Hartmut Hans, DL5SAY, died of cancer in January 2001, aged 54.  He was a radio amateur with much experience, and in his profession he was a software development engineer for telecommunication devices.  During his disease he worked with the NEC (MoM) program, and developed many graphical applications including GNECX.  He was very proud of GNECX and the antenna models.  Some weeks before he died, he told Ursel that he wanted to finish these programs,  but the cancer was stronger.  Included herein are the original GNEC files along with the original NEC files from the wide assortment gathered by Hartmut Hans.  The antenna files and updated TCL files will also appear elsewhere on the site.
In the words of Ursel Kreh, "In international QSOs, he normally called himself Hart because of better understanding.  In March 1965, aged 19, he got his first callsign DL8ON.  Nine years later, still being a student, he gave back his callsign as there was no time and little opportunity for radio amateur activities. The callsign has since been given to an other radio amateur.  In August 1981, Hart applied for a license again obtaining the callsign DL5SAY (which he kept until his death)."  It was during this time that Ursel also participated.

"Hart\\''s enthusiasm concerning amateur radio was the technical aspect.  He bought good devices from Yaesu, and then he started to build further devices himself, e.g. a PA with 500 W and many small devices for the improvement of transmission etc.  The other passion concerning this hobby was to experiment with antennas.  At home he had a normal ground plane and also a butter nut he ordered from USA.  On many vacation trips the amateur radio equipment was part of our baggage, and each time he had new ideas in creating antennas with some "simple wires".  He had a very good feeling for antennas and resulting from this a great knowledge.  The biggest success was our vacation trip to Guadeloupe in October 1992 (with 15 kg equipment) where he threw a wire over the orange trees and where he got many pile ups."

"As Hart\\''s antenna at home had a big range, he had QSOs with people in the whole world, often with American radio amateurs, of course.  He liked to participate in contests and to distribute points.  Very often he only listened to the radio amateur traffic."

"In July 1997, we got the diagnosis of cancer.  In the following 3 1/2 years, we fought together for his life. These years have been full of hope and full of despair.  In this time he needed new purposes in life, and one was to work on antennas.  He spent much time on this.  In parallel, he trained for running, and with the cancer and with chemotherapy, he ran two marathons and several half marathons.  Hartmut died on 31st of January 2001. He was a wonderful person!"

"His whole amateur radio equipment including miles of antenna cables and lots of electrical components etc.  I have given to a small radio amateur club in our town. There are many young people, and the club has not much money, there was no club station, no antenna, etc. These people have been enthusiastic about the comprehensive and good equipment.  I am sure that Hartmut would be glad about my decision."

This antenna library page is dedicated to Hartmut Hans and Ursel Kreh and the extraordinary work and devotion they have both shown to the community.

krehLibrary.tgz (tar gzipped)

GNECX (gnecx1 or gnecx2) is written in TCL and needs the BLT library available on the Internet and possibly in your Linux/Unix distribution.  Several snapshots show this as a useful tool for analysis of NEC output files, which does not provide a graphical interface, results.

The results, animations, and analysis from the krehLibrary model files are included in the NEC Antenna Library section.

Hello,

hopefully you are still reachable via this address. I found it in radio amateur 
papers of my husband. First some explanations why I contact you:

My husband Hartmut Hans, DL5SAY, died in January, aged 54. He was a radio amateur 
with much experience, and in his profession he was developping Software. During 
his disease he worked with your NEC program, and he developped many graphical 
applications. He was very proud of it, and some weeks before he died he told me, 
that he wanted to finish these programs and send them to you. But the cancer was 
stronger, and we didn't talk about these things anymore.

Lateron I tried to find something in his files what could be important, and after 
a long search I found some files. I have sent these files to an other radio 
amateur to ask, if this was what I had looked for. He mailed back, that the files 
were phantastic, containing geometries of many different antennas, with a script 
GNECX.TCL, graphical representations; written in BLT. But then I didnï¿½t hear 
anything more from that guy.

My question: do you mean, that the files could be interesting? Or are there 
already finished programs in the meantime? As I am no radio amateur, I have no 
idea of what they could give you.

If you are interested in getting the files, please send me a short mail, and I 
will direct the files to you.

Best regards
Ursel Kreh

Frau Kreh:

	Thank you for the opportunity to examine the antenna files created
by your late husband.  He had undertaken a large work.

	The materials you sent contain two parts:  

		a.  descriptions of antennas
		b.  software for "convenience"

	The "software for convenience", while especially helpful to your
husband, would probably require another person to have a computer arrangement
close, if not identical, to that of your husband in order to be equally
as convenient for another person.

	The "description of antennas" portion seems quite useful as a
set of examples and as a source that other hams might "mine" for ideas
when they set about creating antennas.

	With your explicit permission, I would like to place
the "descriptions of antennas" on a web site so that they might be
freely available for hams and engineers to use as they desire.  If that
meets with your approval, would you be so kind as to let me know:

	1.  Your late husband's name and callsign so that I might
		attach proper credit to the postings ?

	2.  Perhaps some biographical data for your late husband ?

	3.  Would you desire to contribute a personal note ?

	4.  If you agree, would you be willing to do so in writing
		so that there might be no question about the
		origin and availability of these materials ?


	I will await your next communication, and again I thank you
for the opportunity to examine this work.

Best Regards,

Bill Walker

Hello,

thank you for your information that the files seem to be ok. Now I hope that the 
most important data are included and that you will enjoy them.

Sometimes the world is not so big as it seems - I am located near Stuttgart, 
about 200 km south of Mainz; in American point of view near by. Just one year ago 
we tried to stop the cancer with a special therapy for which we had to go to 
Wiesbaden several times. But we did not succeed.

I wish you all a nice day and a good week. Technical progress is a good thing, 
some years ago we never would have had any contact.

Kind regards
Ursel

Frau Kreh-


	I apologize for not responding.  There is no question of annoyance, 
and you surely did not offend.  (Our university has very large computers,
and it would be very hard to "attach too much"!)

	I confess that I thought I had responded.  I am not surprised
to learn that I have not, however, given the business of the season.

	Thank you for giving permission to use your husband's files
and software.  I plan to "post" them to the Internet, at a site devoted
to antenna design, and with proper credit to your husband.  What was his
amateur radio callsign ?  Could you provide some biographical information
concerning him ?  Perhaps when he was licensed ?  What were his enthusiasms
concerning amateur radio ?  What inspired his interest in antenna work ?

	The web site that I anticipate using is expressly intended for
information such as that contained in your husband's work.  It is hosted
by Ray, WB6TPU, in California.  I will have to check the exact reference.

	When I am looking for work related to antennas, I consult that
web site, as do a lot of other people in the field.  Perhaps you would be
kind enough to compose a note that I could include in the materials and
place on the site?  That note could explain our conversations, and 
provide a "personal flavor" from someone who understood your husband's
enthusiasm and passion more than any other --- namely yourself.

	Again, pardon me for not offering a follow-up sooner.  I can
only claim senility as an excuse!

Hello Bill Walker,

hopefully I did not annoy you with my last mail, resp. with the big attachment. 
Or, perhaps, my mail didnï¿½t reach you? 

If it is a question of time or interest that you didï¿½nt still answer, then it is 
ok. I only want to be sure that you are not angry about the lot of bytes I have

I would be happy about a short answer in any case. Thank you very much in

Frau Kreh--

Thank you for the information you sent.  I shall, in a few days,
try to get all of the materials ready and sent to the web site.

This is the end of term for our university, and I will be rather
busy marking final examinations until the end of the week.  I'll
be sure to send you a note when I place the materials on the web site.

Thank you for all of your kindness and correspondence.

Happy Holidays!

Hello Bill Walker,

now I will give you some detailed information about my late husband. Please feel 
free to shorten it or to cut some parts when you will publicize it, and please 
correct my English where it is necessary (I am writing as words come in my mind
and not with a dictionary on my knees).

The first name of my late husband was Hartmut. In international QSOs he normally 
called himself Hart because of better understanding. In March 1965, aged 19, he 
got his first callsign DL8ON. 9 years later, still being a student, he gave back 
his callsign as there was no time and no opportunity for radio amateur 
activities, perhaps it was also a financial question at that time. The callsign 
had been given to an other radio amateur lateron. 

In August 1981 Hart changed his mind and he applied for a license again. Now he 
got the callsign DL5SAY which he kept until his death. This period of amateur 
radio I participated.

Hartï¿½s enthusiasm concerning amateur radio was the technical aspect. He bought 
good devices from Yaesu, and then he started to build further devices himself, 
e.g. a PA with 500 W and many small devices for the improvement of transmission 
etc. The other passion concerning this hobby was to experiment with antennas. At 
home he had a normal (?) ground plane and also a butter nut he ordered from USA. 
On many vacation trips the amateur radio equipment was part of our baggage, and 
each time he had new ideas in creating antennas with some "simple wires". He had 
a very good feeling for antennas and resulting from this a great knowledge. The 
biggest success was our vacation trip to Guadeloupe in October 1992 (with 15 kg 
equipment) where he throw a wire over the orange trees and where he got many pile 
ups.

As Hartï¿½s antenna at home had a big range he had QSOs with people in the whole 
world, often with American radio amateurs of course. He liked to participate 
contests and to distribute points. Very often he only listened to the radio 
amateur traffic.

In July 1997 we got the diagnosis of cancer. In the following 3 1/2 years we have 
fighted together for his life. These years have been full of hope and full of 
despair. In this time he needed new purposes in life, and one was to work on 
antennas. He spent much time on this. In parallel he trained for running, and 
with the cancer and with chemotherapie he run two marathons and several half 
marathons. Hartmut died on 31th January 2001. He was a wonderful person! 

His whole amateur radio equipment including miles of antenna cables and lots of 
electrical components etc. I have given to a small radio amateur club in our 
town. There are many young people, and the club has not much money, there was no 
club station, no antennna, etc. These people have been enthusiastic about the 
comprehensive and good equipment. I am sure that Hartmut would be glad about my 
decision.

Now I wrote a rather long story, but I think this was necessary to make you a 
little bit familiar with Hartmut. If you really publicize anything from him, 
would you then please so kind to let me know the address of the web site?

I still have a last question: did the graphical antenna diagrams I sent you on 
20th November complete the first information, or are they not necessary to 
understand the work of Hartmut?

I am closing for today with best regards
Ursel.

Hello Bill Walker,

returning just yesterday evening from one week of holidays (I didnï¿½t want to 
spend Christmas in the usual manner this year) I found your greetings. Thank you 
so much.

All the best for you and your familiy in new year and in the whole future, above 
all a lot of health!

There is no need at all to apologize for not yet having worked on Hartmutï¿½s 
files. I myself needed months till I contacted you, and for me that was the most 
important step. Please feel completely free when and in which manner you will 
work on the material.


Best regards and Happy New Year
Ursel Kreh

Hello Bill Walker,

only today I remarked that my mail sent on 20th November didn't reach you. I had 
included too much files - today I try it again with some less files as examples, 
and as I am a little bit lazy I copy the lost mail hereafter:

thank you so much for your answer. I would be glad if somebody could use anything 
of my husbands work, and of course I will give you any permission to publicize 
it, and also some data of my husband. But first I would like to start a further 
trial with some files producing very nice antenna diagrams. I am not sure whether 
they could also be interesting. I know Hartmut worked on them, but perhaps they 
are even resulting from your own SW?

Second point is: could I give some further information concerning the SW? It is 
developped under Linux, and when I open gnecx on my PC I get some kind of pop-up 
for several selections, seems very useful. I wonder if this doesnï¿½t work in your 
environment. The guy to whom I had sent the files (I lost the contact) did also 
not know anything about the computer arrangement of my husband, but he was very 
enthusiastic concerning the program.

Please excuse that I take up your time once again, but I want to be sure that I 
made no mistake in sending uncomplete information. Hopefully you can understand 
me.

Thank you for the time spent! 

Best regards
Ursel Kreh
